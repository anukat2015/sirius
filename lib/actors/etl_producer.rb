# Producer module for implementing ETL consumer - producer Actor protocol.
#
# ETL consumer - producer protocol with back-pressure is rather simple at it's core:
# There are two parties: producer and consumer that are both actor instances.
#
# - Producer produces (by loading, computing, generating, etc.) data (called rows)
# and sends them asynchronously to the consumer.
#
# - Consumer accepts rows from the producer and does something with them (saves them, sends
# them somewhere else, etc.).
#
# Because rows are exchanged asynchronously and consuming could be slower than producing,
# a way how to limit data flow between the actors is needed.
#
# This is solved by utilising back-pressure: Producer must only produce and send rows when consumer
# can accept them. The ability to receive rows is signalled by a message from the consumer to the producer.
# In response to that message a single row can be sent to the consumer. If the producer has no rows
# available for sending at the moment, it should internally store the state of it's consumer and send a row
# when it becomes available. After the consumer is finished with processing the received row, it requests
# another row from the producer and the cycle repeats.
#
